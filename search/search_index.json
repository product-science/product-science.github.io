This can be useful for tracking and comparing timing changes between specific events across traces. The steps to add and use the library are below. Dependencies Add the userflow library as a dependency in app/build.gradle dependencies { implementation \"com.productscience.userflow:userflow:0.15.1\" } Annotation Process There are three static methods used to annotate user flows: UserFlow#start UserFlow#custom UserFlow#end Each of these methods take an integer argument (UserFlow ID) and a nullable String argument (comment). 1. Starting a UserFlow To start a UserFlow, call UserFlow#start and pass it an ID and a String message. UserFlow . start ( 1 , \"App start begins\" ) 2. Annotations UserFlow's milestones While a UserFlow is in progress, you can make calls to UserFlow#custom passing the UserFlow ID and a String message. This can be useful to annotate events along the UserFlow (e.g., reaching a milestone or annotating different conditional paths among others). UserFlow . custom ( 1 , \"UserFlow hit milestone\" ) 3. Ending a UserFlow To end a UserFlow, call UserFlow#end passing the ID of the UserFlow to end and a String message. UserFlow . end ( 1 , \"App start complete\" ) Examples UserFlow Annotations on PSTool Sample app There is a sample app demonstrating the use of the userflow library at: https://github.com/product-science/demoapps-private/tree/main/Android/userflow-android-example Project Integration By default, UserFlow Annotations are added to traces only when Product Science plugin is applied. To annotate user flows without applying the plugin, call UserFlow#setAlwaysAnnotate(true) . CAUTION : using this method can enable unwanted annotations in production builds.

Configure and Test xcodebuild Prepare an xcodebuild command to build the app in terminal. For projects that are organized with xcworkspace : xcodebuild \\ -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace \\ -scheme MyAppScheme \\ -sdk iphoneos For xcodeproj based projects: xcodebuild \\ -project MyApp.xcodeproj \\ -scheme MyAppScheme \\ -sdk iphoneos Ensure that your app can build successfully before using the PSCliCodeInjector . A reference example using the Firefox Fennec iOS app is shown below. 4. Install PSTools Instrumentation Injection Kit You will need to use the github credentials supplied by PSi to above to follow these steps: Download the latest PSTools-PLATFORM.zip from this link and unzip it Install PSTools/PSCliCodeInjector.pkg on your Mac with double-click Copy PSTools/PSKit to ps-workdir i.e. cp -r PSTools/PSKit . See the Firefox example below for sample final directory structure. Please label your build with the PSi Plugin Version from above i.e. MyAppPSi0.9.1.ipa so our AI can learn how its dynamic instrumentation is performing on the build. 5.

A backup of the original will be in MyApp-BACKUP . The BUILD-COMMAND-FROM_STEP-2 is the choice between the xcworkspace or xcodeproj methods and their associated flags. These are examples of xcodebuild templates- yours may differ. See the Firefox app example below. \u26a0\ufe0f Warning: PSCliCodeInjector parses the command\u2019s output to identify issues with the injected code. Be sure not to pipe the build\u2019s results through tools like xcbeautify, xcpretty, etc. or this logic might not work correctly. When complete, the MyApp directory will have been transformed.
